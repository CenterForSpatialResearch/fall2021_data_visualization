//ASSIGNMENT:
//using the data file income_dropout.csv in this chapter's folder.
//draw a scatterplot using the values in the columns for "dropout_rate",and "median_income"
//make sure the scale and axes for the plot fits well in the page. 
//I have created x and y scales for you that will work but you can also change to your liking.
//create 2 more scales to color and resize the circles based on 1 or both of the columns of values.

			//Width and height
			var w = 800;
			var h = 800;
			var padding = 40;
			
			//Load in the data
			d3.csv("income_dropout.csv")
            .then(function(data) {
			//console.log(data) //uncomment so you can see the data printed out and familiarize yourself with it.
				
				//here are the 2 scales that I have created based on the previous code file in this chapter. There is 1 point of change in each of the scales below and that is "parseFloat()". The reason behind these 2 additions is that sometime data will load in as a string, and we are unable to do calculations such as max and min for the scales if the data values are interpreted as strings.
				
			var xScale = d3.scaleLinear()
				.domain([0,d3.max(data, function(d) {return parseFloat(d["dropout_rate"]); })])
				.range([padding,w-padding]);
							   
			var yScale = d3.scaleLinear()
				.domain([0, d3.max(data, function(d) { return parseFloat(d["median_income"]); })])
				.range([h - padding, padding]);
				
           //TODO: make a linear scale named cScale for the colors you will use
           //HINT: the domain is the values from the data, you must use parseFloat() again like above to make sure that the value is not a string, and the range is an array of 2 colors such as ["red","blue"]
			//TODO: make a linear scale for the radius of the circles in the scatterplot.
			           
			//TODO: I have defined the axes below, please call them to add to SVG in the correct position
				//Define X axis
				xAxis = d3.axisBottom()
								  .scale(xScale)
								  .ticks(9)

				//Define Y axis
				yAxis = d3.axisLeft()
								  .scale(yScale)
								  .ticks(10);

                                  

				//Create SVG element
				var svg = d3.select("body")
							.append("svg")
							.attr("width", w)
							.attr("height", h);

				
				//TODO: draw your scatterplot and then add x and y axes
